I've used some of Kosmic's code for this project, so thanks to him.

I have changed: Assets.cs, to add my custom assets, I have changed Images.resx and Images.Designer.cs to add images in.

This mod adds in some towers that were too small to make into their own mods, sort of like a Custom Tower pack.

Towers:

Bloonjitsu (5 upgrades)

Sun-Terror (3-5-0 super monkey, no upgrades)

Bionic MOAR Glaives (4-3-0 boomerang monkey, no upgrades)

Bombjitsu (4-0-3 ninja monkey, no upgrades)

Operation: Neva-Miss (4-0-3 monkey ace, no upgrades)

Ace Gunner (short ranged monkey ace, 5 upgrades)

Triple Juggernaut (4-3-2 dart monkey (no attack speed bonus), no upgrades)

Cannon Destroyer (3-3-0 monkey buccaneer, no upgrades)

Blade Sprayer (2-3-3 tack shooter, no upgrades)

Retro Banana Farm (btd 4 banana farm (cash per round), 5 upgrades)

Unloader Dartling Gunner (btd x left path dartling gunner (sort of like buckshot), no upgrades)
