I've used some of Kosmic's code for this project, so thanks to him.

I have changed: Assets.cs, to add my custom assets, I have changed Images.resx and Images.Designer.cs to add images in.

This mod adds in some towers that were too small to make into their own mods, sort of like a Custom Tower pack.
