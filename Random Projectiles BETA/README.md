Thanks Timotheee for original random projectiles mod source, which I used to make this mod.

This is mod a edit of Timotheee's random projectiles, to make it so everything about the projectile is randomized, not just the display.

For example, in Timotheee's mod, if a tower shoots a banana nothing unique would happen, however in my edit you would be able to pick it up and earn money.

Also, thanks Kosmic for the idea (Random projectiles in Massive mod)
